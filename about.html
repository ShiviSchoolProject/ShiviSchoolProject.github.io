                        <h5><span>What Is Programming</span> & Why Do I Like It?</h5>
                        <p>My hobby is programming and my goal is to become a software engineer. Website development to me is very fascinating because you can do so much with it and it is one of the first things you need to learn before creating applications and games. Other than web development, you can do so many things like making games, creating A.I. bots and making apps. Programming has a lot of languages that do different things such as Python, JavaScript, Java, C and C++. Some of them are simple like Python but some are more advanced like Java. Over the years, Python has become one of the most popular languages because of how easy it is to learn and the number of jobs you can get with it. Although programming looks fun, sometimes it may be challenging because a simple typo in your code can ruin an entire project. I hope you learnt a little more of programming and thank you for visiting my website!</p>
